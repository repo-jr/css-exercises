# Chaining Selectors
With this exercise we've provided you a completed HTML file, so you will only have to edit the CSS file. It's more important to understanding how chaining different selectors works for this exercise than actually adding the attributes.

We have two different elements for you to style, each with two class names where one of the class names is shared. The goal here is to chain the selectors for both elements so that each have a unique style applied despite using a shared class selector. In other words, you want an element that has both X and Y to have one set of styles, while an element with X and Z has a completely different set of styles.
