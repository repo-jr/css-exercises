# CSS Exercises

These exercises are a series of css related tasks intended to complement the HTML and CSS content on The Odin Project.

These exercises should be done when instructed during the course of the curriculum.

Generally, they consist of a simple html file with some markup and some basic CSS. Open the html file in your browser and then do your best to make the output match the `desired-output` screenshot. Unless instructed otherwise, don't stress _too_ much about getting the _exact_ value for font-sizes, margins and paddings. It can be hard to tell from screenshots what the precise value is. If you put in 14px and find the actual value is 16px, consider that a success.

In many cases, there will be multiple correct ways to solve these problems. The official solution isn't necessarily the _right_ way, but it is possible to do things in ways that are overall unhelpful.  If your solution differs wildly from the official solution, feel free to ask about it in the chatroom.
