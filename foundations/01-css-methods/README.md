# Methods for Adding CSS
In this exerrcise, you're going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file using all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS.

There are three elements for you to add styles to, each of which uses a different method of adding CSS to it, as noted in the outcome image below. All other exercises in this section will have a CSS file provided and linked for you, but for this exercise you will have to create the file and link it in the HTML file yourself.

You should only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles via the external and internal methods.
